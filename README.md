## Overview
The purpose of this statistical analysis is to find out if there is an ideal temperature that can be sustained year round in the location where W. Avy is looking to open his surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Temperature sample data will be taken in both June and September and this information will be used to provide summary statistics. Hopefully the numbers will fall within the parameters that W. Avy is looking for. 

## Results
- More samples were taken in the month of June than December
- The mean temperature is slightly higher in June than in December
- The maximum temperature is slightly higher in June than in December

### Summary
Overall I believe the temperatures are consistently warm enough to open a shop year round. I feel confident in giving the green light to conduct more research before opening the surf shop. 

I stromgly recommend conducting further analysis before deciding if the shop should open. I would do a weather sample comparison within the last 10 tears at least, comparing average monthly temperatures. Weather can vary so much from an annual perspective. Also, I would look at other weather factors that affect surfing, including rain levels and wind speed. Lastly, I would conduct a competitive landscape analysis to see how many other surf shops are on the island of Oahu, and look into the type of services they offer.
