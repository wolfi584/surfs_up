## Overview
The purpose of this statistical analysis is to find out if there is an ideal temperature that can be sustained year round in the location where W. Avy is looking to open his surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Temperature sample data will be taken in both June and September and this information will be used to provide summary statistics. Hopefully the numbers will fall within the parameters that W. Avy is looking for. 

## Results
I do not feel comfortable listing three key differences between the weather of June and December, because my statistical summary numbers do not match the examplse listed in the challenge summary for both June and December. 

### Summary
Although my statistical analysis did not match the example images in this challenge, I have a couple of concerns about the data analysis. I would also do a weather sample comparison within the last 5-10 tears at least, comparing average monthly temperatures. Weather can vary so much from an annual perspective. Also, I would look at other weather factors that could affect surfers, including rain levels and wind speed. Lastly, I would conduct a competitive landscape analysis to see how many other surf shops are on the island of Oahu, and look into the type of services they offer.
